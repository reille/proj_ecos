//=============================================================================
// This is a quick loopback test for the STM32 I2C driver.  It works with the
// STM3240G-EVAL board with the JP26 shorted. There are still problems with
// the hardware itself. It appears that some device is is performing clock
// stretching preventing fast mode operation. Some registers don't read properly
// although a 3 device PMBus board attached with cables using addresses 0x30 0x32
// and 0x33 seem to read and write properly. You can run this test with both
// interrupt and polled mode and should get the same results.
//
// Also note that the origonal code was for a STM321X board and this test case
// was never run against that board after modifying it for the latest codebase.
